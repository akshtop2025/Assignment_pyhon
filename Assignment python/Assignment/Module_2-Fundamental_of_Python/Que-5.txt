Que-5 : What is the purpose continue statement in python? 

------> In Python, the continue statement is used within loops (such as for loops and 	while loops) to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next 	iteration. When the continue statement is encountered, the code inside the loop's 	body after the continue statement is skipped, and the loop's control immediately 	goes to the next iteration.
