Que-2: How will you remove last object from a list?Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and  	       25], what is list1 [-1]?

-----> The method pop() can be used to remove and return the last value from the list or          the given index value. If the index is not given, then the last element is popped 	       out and removed.
       - [2, 33, 222, 14,25]
       - Here negative indexing starts from right end that means the index of 25 is -1
